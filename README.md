Information and usefull links for current Bristol Geography PGRs.

## What's new?

With most of the restrictions taken down, it has been announced that we can **all come back to browns**. There are 2 conditions.
1. You should be wearing masks inside, unless youâ€™re not consuming food or are the only one in the room.
2. You should take LFT every 3-4 days. You can get them for free in pharmacies, or order them online [here](https://www.gov.uk/order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow-tests)

If your LFT test is positive or you have symptoms, please book yourself for [PCR test](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/get-tested-for-coronavirus/). If you do get Covid-19 and have been at the university, please let someone know. This could be your supervisor, member of staff or just send a message on PGR WhatsApp, or let one of our PGR representatives know, so we can organize the space and the students accordingly.


## Browns setting and hot-desking

To make people more comfortable about coming to Browns, we decided to create check-in system. In a spreadsheet below, you can find not just the seating plan, but a also a calendar where you can indicate when you will be in browns. This way, everyone can see (1) how many people is currently in each room, (2) how many people is in Browns total, and (3) what desks are available for hot-desking. This should give everyone the freedom to decide if it's safe or comfortable for them to come into browns or not.

It's simple. If you are going to Browns, leave the cells green, if you are coming in that day, colour the cell red. Please apply the same process for hot-desks.
